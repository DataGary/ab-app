                The chi-square test of independence was conducted to assess the association between two categorical variables. 

                ### Results
                - Chi-square value: {round(stat,2)}
                - Degrees of freedom: {dof}
                - p-value: {round(p,4)}
                - Phi: {round(phi_effect,2)} (effect size)
                - Odds Ratio (OR): {round(odds_ratio_xi,2)}
                - Power: {round(pwr,3)}

                ### Interpretation

                The p-value of {round(p,4)} is less than the significance level of {significance_level}, indicating that there is a statistically significant difference between the two groups. The effect size (Phi) is {round(phi_effect,2)}, which is considered a ({effect_string}) effect. The odds ratio (OR) of {round(odds_ratio_xi,2)} suggests that there is a {round(odds_ratio_xi,2)} times higher odds of the outcome occurring in one group compared to the other. The power of the test is {round(pwr,3)}, which means that the test has a {round(pwr*100,1)}% probability of detecting a statistically significant effect if one exists.

                # Fisher's Exact Test

                The Fisher's exact test was conducted to assess the association between two categorical variables in a 2x2 contingency table. The Fisher's exact test was chosen because one or more of the values in the contingency table were lower or equal to 5, which would not meet the assumption of the chi-square test.

                ### Results
                - p-value: {round(p,4)}

                The p-value of {round(p,4)} is less than the significance level of {significance_level}, indicating that there is a statistically significant difference between the two groups and rejecting the null hypothesis that there is no difference between the two groups. The odds ratio (OR) of {round(odds_ratio_fi,2)} suggests that there is a {round(odds_ratio_fi,2)} times higher odds of the outcome occurring in one group compared to the other.
